# Python-Pet-Management-System
The Python program defines a **`Pet` class** that represents pets with attributes — **name**, **type**, and **age**. It includes methods to **display pet details** and **update a pet’s age**. Two pets, *Buddy* (a dog) and *Whiskers* (a cat), are created, their information is displayed, Buddy’s age is updated, and the updated details are shown.
